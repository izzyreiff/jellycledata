Notes:
This show is magical, Phillipa is captivating, and the entire ensemble is perfectly quirky. There have been a few changes since Berkeley that tighten up the show a bit and make it ready for Broadway. A near perfect capture with no washout, no obstruction, and just one very quick dropout. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

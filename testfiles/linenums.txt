Line 8: Notes:
Line 9: A compilation of all known footage of the Mean Girls 2.0 Cast on their debut night! Includes audio and video clips, and photos of the show as well as 3 different Curtain Call videos. This is pretty much the closest thing we have to a full bootleg unless something comes up in the future. I am not the master of any of these photos or clips. To be gifted upon request.

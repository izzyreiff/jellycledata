& Juliet - Broadway
October, 2022 - catherinewasamassivec
CAST:
Lorna Courtney (Juliet), Betsy Wolfe (Anne Hathaway), Stark Sands (William Shakespeare), Ben Jackson Walker (Romeo), Philippe Arroyo (Francois), Justin David Sullivan (May), Melanie La Barrie (Nurse "Angelique"), Paulo Szot (Lance), Veronica Otim (Lady Capulet/Nell), Nicholas Edwards (Lord Capulet/Sly), Tiernan Tunnicliffe (Eleanor/Benvolio), Virgil Gadson (Augustine), Matt Raffy (Gregory), Joe Moeller (Henry), Jasmine Rafael (Imogen), Rachel Webb (Judith), Joomin Hwang (Kempe), Megan Kane (Lucy), Brandon Antonio (Richard), Bobby "Pocket" Horner (Rumour)
NOTES:
Do we have unobstructed footage? No. Do we have optimal exposure levels? No. BUT, do we have all the action captured? No. 1080p landscape cropped from vertical 4K – the phone was pointed at the stage between heads in a semi-stable position. Not a substitute for an actually good video, but watchable for what it is.

NOTES:
Good quality video, video starts 5 minutes into the show and the right side of the stage is obstructed for 20 minutes before I was able to move to a better seat. After that, there is minimal obstructions and the action is captured well. Brief and miminal drifting, unfocusedness and drop-outs. Included is a full audio from this performance and a quality-enhanced edited version by @bsangeloni!

NOTES:
A washed out phone video (no zooms) with a fair bit of head obstruction and shakiness, and some of the left side of the stage cut off most of the time. Starts about 5-10 minutes in because I forgot to hit records. But a pretty good companion to my first video, as it mostly captures the few scenes that had some dropouts in that video.

NOTES:
Really beautiful shot in an intimate space. Lots of zooms, but a good amount of wider shots too with a very limited (almost nonexistent) amount of heads. The lighting in this theater really liked my camera and I know the show almost “by heart” so I think I followed the action as well as possible. My battery died during the last song, but it starts at the very beginning with only one drop out during dialogue.

NOTES:
This show is magical, Phillipa is captivating, and the entire ensemble is perfectly quirky. There have been a few changes since Berkeley that tighten up the show a bit and make it ready for Broadway. A near perfect capture with no washout, no obstruction, and just one very quick dropout. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

NOTES:
Considering the circumstances, this is a great capture of the Chicago premiere of this show. This production was staged on a runway down the middle of a large room. Audience was seated on both sides of the stage and actors were frequently in all of the aisles. As a result, actor's backs are sometimes facing the camera and ensemble actors sometimes obscure the main action in a scene. Because of the layout, it was impossible to capture the entire stage/runway, so only the middle of the runway is filmed. Unfortunately Act two was very dark so, while most of the action is there, sometimes the picture is less than stellar from the attempt to lighten the footage enough to see anything. Lastly, lots of reactions can be heard from the woman next to me (she was drunk and had several friends in the show so was super vocal). Despite the aforementioned issues, it's a pretty good video and perfectly watchable.

NOTES:
Act one picks up in the middle of the prologue music box scene. There's a lot of wandering and shaking at the start but it gets better as the video goes on. Act two starts in the middle of Paris Holds the Key. Sound quality is not the best, it fizzes out when things get too loud and there's quite a bit of rustling (especially in the second act) because of how I was holding my camera. There's a head blocking the bottom left corner of the video, in wide shots but it's worked around for close ups. There's a blackout in the middle of Rumor in St Petersburg and one while dimitry and vlad are talking in the scene before In My Dreams. Video ends before curtain call.

John Tartaglia (Princeton/Rod), Stephanie D'Abruzzo (Kate Monster/Lucy the Slut), Rick Lyon (Nicky/Trekkie/Bad Idea Bear), Natalie Venetia Belcon (Gary Coleman), Ann Harada (Christmas Eve), Jennifer Barnhart (Mrs. Thistletwat/Bad Idea Bear), Jordan Gelber (Brian)
NOTES:
Great picture and sound with camera coverup occasionally throughout the video but not too distracting. The October 18, 2003 video often gets mislabeled as this one. This video can also circulate as July 20th. Unclear which date is correct (the menu file says July 20th, but most traders have it listed as July 26th). Includes extra clips of the show performing on the Tonys, Live With Regis & Kelly and The View. Also includes the same Breakfast with the Arts clip as the October 18th video (which likely causes the mislabel confusion). Check screen shots to confirm, as they are different.

NOTES:
Excellent 4K capture of this show's third preview! Heads are visible along the bottom, but only the left side has some obstruction. A little action is blocked off, mostly when characters are sitting or laying down on the floor. Some wandering / readjustment and unfocusing throughout, and the beginning of act two is especially messy. Some washout on wider shots. Some overloaded audio from cheering. Includes curtain call and encore sequence, audio is fed from external source. Joshua was on for Kevin Curtis's track.

Beetlejuice - Broadway
March, 2019 - StarCuffedJeans
 Partial Recording
CAST:
Alex Brightman (Beetlejuice), Sophia Anne Caruso (Lydia Deetz), Kerry Butler (Barbara Maitland), Rob McClure (Adam Maitland), Adam Dannheisser (Charles Deetz), Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer (Delia Deetz/Miss Argentina), Kelvin Moon Loh (Otho), Danny Rutigliano (Maxie Dean), Jill Abramovitz (Maxine Dean/Juno), Dana Steingold (Girl Scout)
NOTES:
Previews! This is probably my most obstructed bootleg ever. When I could get zooms they're pretty (and I'm really trying my hardest for both Sophia and Kerry - “Dead Mom” looks GREAT and is really consistent), but I would probably consider this more like highlights with how many heads keep popping up. I don't love it, but you can keep up with what is happening and see the WILD effects they have going on here...which is good enough for now. Video starts at “Ready, Set, Not Yet” and is complete from there. And honestly this video (and this show) is worth it just for “Dead Mom.”

NOTES:
Full HD stageshot filmed from the front orchestra! This is fairly better than the other stageshot, including less heads, more facial features, but one major head that's sometimes filmed around whenever the master isn't wandering downward. Great video quality overall and it includes full Act One and Act Two starting at Beetlejuice's entrance after Girl Scout through Curtain Call! Notes From Medium: no original files exist, only the original YouTube Rip. I have the oldest copy, The files are only about 1.5 GB each I'm not sure where everyone got the 13 GB video but feel free to email for the oldest copy of this video.

NOTES:
Not great (but full) capture of the now closed musical. Shot Between the Heads (ha!), so lots of obstruction. Shaky camera, constant & awkward adjustment of exposure, Act 2 is camcorder audio which has issues. Beautiful visual quality when the camera is steady. First four minutes of Act 1 are audio only, Act 2 starts a little bit of the way in. Good for people who have seen the show and want to rewatch certain clips (especially Wren's parts.) Posting on public sites is a stupid idea, sales are not explicitly disallowed despite being a worse idea. Gift (to friends, traders, and small groups) when time and storage allow.

The Book of Mormon - UK & Ireland Tour
August, 2019 - blazingphoenix
CAST:
Kevin Clay (Elder Price), Conner Peirson (Elder Cunningham), Nicole-Lily Baisden (Nabulungi), William Hawksworth (Elder McKinley), Ewen Cummins (Mafala Hatimbi), Patrick George (u/s Mission President), Thomas Vernal (General), Brad Veitch (Cunningham's Father), Tre Copeland-Williams (Doctor), Johnathan Tweedie (Price's Father), Johnathan Tweedie (Prices Dad/Joseph Smith/Mission President), Cleopatra Isaac (Mrs. Brown), Jemal Felix (Guard), Lukin Simmonds (Guard)
NOTES:
First video! Unfortunately the theatre has very active ushers. Blind-shot between two heads, missing the lip of stage but actors' heads are still visible; shaky with limited zoom, spotlight washout throughout. Post editing zoom to focus on the stage. Begins at ‘You and Me (But Mostly Me)' and includes a lot of dropouts, significantly long ones at ‘Turn It Off' and ‘All American Prophet'. At points, angles are weird due to hiding the camera, moving it to follow the action, and on occasion, dropping it. Personally, Act 2 is filmed more consistently than Act 1.

With just a broom, a pencil, and a dream for a better life, a budding guitarist — unsure of his place in the cosmos — invokes the past, present & future of rhythm ‘n’ blues as his guide. Rocking and rolling with the hippest ancestral spirit, our young hero must set aside his fears and dig deep to discover his own voice.

NOTES:
Final performance. An electric performance right from the start. The enthusiastic audience is extremely supportive, and the cast gives emotional performances. Steve Martin joins the band for the Entr'Acte, and there's a standing ovation for him, as well as for Carmen following At Long Last. There were no speeches given, but the curtain call was much longer than usual with Steve, Edie, and Walter all taking bows, and Steve doing a short impromptu tap number. This is beautifully captured with no obstruction. There is a one minute blackout over the first scene just before She's Gone, but the rest of the show is complete. There is some slight washout in a few of the wider shots. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes the entire extended curtain call and playbill scans.

Cabaret - Fifth West End Revival

CAST:
Eddie Redmayne (Emcee), Jessie Buckley (Sally Bowles), Omari Douglas (Cliff), Liza Sadovy (Fraulein Schneider), Elliot Levey (Herr Schultz), Stewart Clarke (Ernst Ludwig), Anna-Jane Casey (Fraulein Kost/Fritzie), Sally Frith (Frenchie), Matthew Gent (Hans), Theo Maddix (Lulu), Daniel Perry (Victor), Andre Refig (Max), Christopher Tendai (Bobby), B Terry (Helga), Lillie-Pearl Wildman (Texas), Sophie Maria Wojna (Rosie)
NOTES:
This is the only publicly released video recording of this acclaimed, sold out production with the original West End revival cast. This was my first time recording and as a result mistakes were made. Foolishly, I set the exposure to automatic so the recording suffered from spotlight washout (I haven't made this mistake since). The washout has mostly been fixed in editing as it's impossible to fully correct. The recording has more zooms than I would like to prevent further washout. Fortunately, this production is minimalistic and performance focused so it doesn't hinder the overall experience of the show. The recording is mainly filmed in close ups and mediums. A head is sometimes visible in the wide shots of the musical numbers. Recording includes the curtain call and marquee.

Filmed professionally for the RSC archives on the third night of the performance (February 16, 1988). Shot from first row mezzanine center with no obstructions with audio taken directly from the soundboard. This is usually incorrectly labelled as "Opening Night (February 13, 1988)", which is incorrect, as on opening night, Barbara Cook was almost decapitated right after the set changes from "Don't Waste The Moon", which not seen in this video (also verified by the person who copied this from the archives). Audio is not from the soundboard.

The only thing "bad" about this video is that it's missing the first couple seconds of the "All That Jazz Overture."

CAST:
Ashlee Simpson (Roxie Hart), Samantha Barks (Velma Kelly), Stephen Moyer (Billy Flynn), Drew Carey (Amos Hart), Lucy Lawless (Matron "Mama" Morton), D Tablak (Mary Sunshine)
NOTES:
A fantastic capture of the Hollywood Bowl's yearly spectacle, directed by Brooke Shields. The show is completely intact from start to finish, filmed on a tripod so it's very steady throughout. The first few minutes are a bit shaky and there's obstruction that blocks the actors' feet, but both issues are fixed after All That Jazz. Filmed in 16:9 with wides and mediums. No close-ups due to the distance from the stage. Includes curtain call.

The timeless tale of Ebenezer Scrooge comes to thrilling new life as Tony Award ® winner Jefferson Mays (I Am My Own Wife, Gentlemen's Guide…) plays over 50 roles in a virtuosic, master class of a performance that must be seen to be believed.

First preview – I met Andrew LLoyd Webber before the show, and he told me to enjoy it, so I did. Filmed around A Big Head, which I tried to overcome with zooms, but unfortunately it creates an obstruction sometimes nonetheless.

Late (10:30PM show) with 'special guests' Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss in attendance – their intro wasn't shown/mic'd for the stream, but you can see them in the audience. This was also one of the 'pride performance' dates, whatever that means (some minor lines were cut compared to the first preview, but overall the exact same show), but the audience definitely had extra good vibes.

Great wide-shot phone boot of this amazing cast that just keeps getting better. Filmed from right hand side of the stage, some of the darker scenes (only a few in this production) are a bit underexposed, but most action is filmed. Tiny bit is missed in Act one on the far back of the stage. Corrected for Act 2. As always this show is phenomenal. Especially loved Gabrielle Rice understudying Sofia. She had big shoes to fill and she did great. Never to be sold. Gifting Encouraged

NOTES:
Technical Notes: Stageshot. Excellent capture. No obstructions. Almost no washout. No dropouts. Excellent audio (though is apologetically bombarded by frequent scream laughing from me.) There's a brief show stop immediately after the title number, and the video captures the curtain coming down and the resuming of the performance. The first act unfortunately loses its picture a few minutes after Not Getting Married today - especially unfortunate as the performance was one of the last which featured rain during Marry Me a Little. Shot from front row stage left. [A] Performance Notes: This production is the most premium musical theatre experience I have ever had in my life. I could simply go on for hours about how magnificent this entire production was - Katrina's bottomlessly fleshed-out interpretation of Bobbie, Patti LuPone's masterclass display of performing, Jennifer Simard's nomination-worthy comedy, Christopher Sieber's perfect matching and prodding of his scene partner, Claybourne Elder's show-stealing acting, Bobby Conte's booming vocals, Marianne Elliot's ability to make this total re-envisioning utterly airtight dramaturgically, Bunny Christie's masterful and detailed set design, Neil Austin's exacting lighting design executed to meticulous precision, Ian Dickinson's complex sound design. This is a thorough gift to Broadway and this video captures a performance at its absolutely perfect settling point.

NOTES:
Stunning and intense production of this Arthur Miller classic. There is a head that is shot over on the left side of the stage. It usually just blocks the actor's legs when in the frame, which is worked around well. The last 10 seconds of the show (Elizabeth's speech) are missing due to length of show and battery running out.

About 15 minutes in there's a sequence of short blackouts lasting a total of one minute. Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source.

Starts a little bit before "Requiem" but is full from there. Small obstruction on bottom right of the screen for some of the show, and camera can be jumpy at times. That aside, the picture quality is beautiful, and pretty much all of the important actions are caught. The master obviously knew the show well. Released by SCJ, mastered by bluebird.

Revamping the tales of ‘happily ever after' in an empowering all-female musical romp, Disenchanted brings together a band of not-so-merry princesses, keen to rewrite their tales as old as time. Tossing their tiaras and setting the record straight, the royal renegades are here to comically belt out the truths that fairy-tales would have preferred stayed quiet.

The cast is fantastic, giving great performances all around. This is a nice capture with no washout, no blackouts, and very minor obstruction. There are a couple heads that can be seen at the bottom of the screen, but they never affect the action. The sound is very good overall, but there is more shuffling and static than usual; all of the dialogue is listenable. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

NOTES:
The engaging Donna Vivino is a child star gone good. Having originated the role of Young Cosette on Broadway in Les Miserables she has since gone on to play other iconic roles on Broadway including Elphaba in Wicked and Grizabella in Cats. After quarantining in rural Maine and hanging with farmers who have never even heard of musical theatre or the word diva, she is back in NYC and spilling all the tea about her life both on and off Broadway. Also...she belts all the Broadway hits and infuses her comedic impersonation into her stories all in an intimate setting. Livestream ripped by BenTheChipsAreDown.

Due to audio disturbances from other shows on the night of filming, the songs “Chuck’s Lament,” “Not Like Other Girls (Reprise)", and “Prom Queen/True Love” have been dubbed with audio from the official cast recording. Additionally, during one small scene, some offstage chatter and door squeaking may be heard. We have tried our best to mitigate these errors in the recording and apologize for any inconvenience this might cause to your viewing of “Dusk.”

A phone boot but zoomed in, some wandering at the first song, but way better after that. Lost the last two songs, but i got the cabaret! Eva is more reserved today, guess it will be the audio footage During the cabaret, the person sitting in front of me is leaning foward and someone is leaving. You can find an annoying head at the right of the stage and cover Eva for one line

Multiple copies circulating, some with more gen loss than others. Make sure to ask for screencaps from the person you're trading with. The screencaps seem to be from a copy with higher gen loss.

NOTES:
London's National Theatre production, broadcast live to cinemas around the world. The National Theatre revival is the first fully staged major London production of Follies to present the original Broadway version of the show. Sondheim and Goldman revised large parts of the show's script and score for its 1987 London premiere, toning down the underlying bleakness of the Broadway original, and offering a more hopeful finale for its central characters. Director Dominic Cooke revisited early drafts of Goldman's script, restoring original dialogue and moments that have not been seen in the production since its 1971 Broadway run.

NOTES:
Technical Notes: HD stageshot with zooms. No obstructions, no washout. Excellent sound. Captures all of the first act, which ends with Too Many Mornings. Shot from stage left balcony. The video should come with audio of Act II. [A] Performance Notes: What a thrilling night of theatre! This gala concert performance featured some of the most glittering stars in Toronto theatre, with truly stand-out performances from Marcus Nance, Cynthia Dale, Charlotte Moore, and Gabriel Antonacci. I was miserably unable to film the second act, which featured a lot more staging including wonderfully choreographed numbers in The Story of Lucy and Jessie, The Right Girl, and a humorous interpretation of Buddy's Blues featuring crude hand puppets. Gratefully, the first act captures the bulk of the company's solos and does so in flawless quality with gorgeous colour, sound, and zooms. A simply dazzling performance.

NOTES:
Halfway decent wide-shot phone video from the mid orchestra. Local star Katie Markiko Murray debuted her Anna track and the crowd was electric. Never seen so much support for one person on a tour before. It was beautiful. Video is a little washed out at times, a head covers about 15% of the video in act 1, improves in Act 2. Bar obstructs the very bottom of the stage, but doesn't cut off more than feet. Includes video, audio (Tracked by GloryOfTheSpring and untracked), digital program, and cast/understudy board pics.

NOTES:
Pretty good wide-shot phone boot from center orchestra. Very small venue led to an intimate performance of this emotionally powerful show. Head in front on the left side covers up some of the torsos and legs on some scenes, but most action caught quite well. Beautiful audio, wonderful performances from everyone.

NOTES:
Nearly full video, good quality! Starts with 15 seconds of silence as I get my camera ready. First 15-20min are out of focus at points. No video for two minutes in the middle, replaced with photos of the production. Lots of obstruction on the sides that blocks important plot details, so not a good first watch. This audio was really difficult to edit due to poor mic positioning on my part and definitely some strange acoustics from the theater, but I think I did okay!

June 24, 2022 - Pro-Shot
CAST:
Taylor Ratliff (Grindr), Noah Hartwell (Jack), Coleman Steele Cumming (Tom), Terrance Johnson (Devon), Kevin McGuire (Don)
NOTES:
GRINDR The Opera puts the most notorious gay hook-up app into the exaggerated world of opera. With musical styles ranging from baroque to contemporary pop, GRINDR The Opera is a daring, humorous look at the changing landscape of gay relationships, and the greatest catalyst for the shift: GRINDR. Though the opera lives in the world of parody, it touches on some very serious, hot-button issues that exist in the gay community as it transitions into a time of wider acceptance and easy access to opportunities of both romance and lust to be sated.

NOTES:
Decent wide-shot phone boot from the Mezz. Some of the brighter scenes suffer from washout, and unfortunately some of the hats can't be read during a few scenes, but there's zero obstruction. Action only missed when the character comes through the door a few times that was too far upstage (couldn't even see it from my seat). Very lively audience who were absolutely living for Josh and Andrew breaking character in Act 2.

NOTES:
Don't expect much. Unfortunately the entire first act is blurry. Not terribly blurry, you can still see the choreography and projections, but not much facial features. 2nd Act is slightly better, but still pretty far away. Wide-shot phone boot. Excellent cast, as we were all expecting. Sorry for coughing, still decent audio. Hope someone else can get a better video capture of this show! Never to be sold. Gifting Encouraged

NOTES:
Previews! Picks up after "Road to Hell." Decent capture with a lot of beautiful zooms, two really annoying heads, and a drop out occasionally but never for long (For the first time in my mastering career I kept putting the camera down after musical numbers because I couldn't NOT clap). This was my first time seeing the show and hearing this music so I was sometimes focused on the wrong things. Oh well. Overall, I love this video. I got home at 2AM after filming it and just SOBBED while I rewatched some of my favorite moments. WHAT A SHOW.!

NOTES:
Full stage-shot of Hadestown Broadway filmed from the second row. The only known full video of the OBC post-opening, because the other videos are either a) previews or b) have at least one replacement actor (due to Ahmad Simmons and Afra Hines leaving fairly early) or c) are not quite the full show. Some head obstruction and tilt, but what can be seen is good due to the filmer being so close. Do not ask for master contact - without getting into too much info, the filmer ended up being a bigot and a creep to cast members, and although this video is not a leak and the distributors have permission to share, they all want to be careful and know who's getting it. Gift Upon Request to those who ask (via distributors only), but please don't share the video or link in any public setting, and make edits/gifs at your own discretion.

NOTES:
Shot from the front mezzanine, front of stage action is captured great from between the bar. The bar obstructs a bit when performers are on the upper levels of the stage but overall very watchable. Capture includes the entire show, including partial curtain call (missing We Raise Our Cups). With my other master, you can get a great visual of the entirety of the show's beautiful choreography and staging.

NOTES:
Amber Gray's final performance in Hadestown. Full show is filmed, including the standing ovation that Amber got before the performance even started, right up to the band exiting. Moderate obstruction from the box/bar, etc. Dropouts and shakiness during applause breaks, especially during all of the standing ovations that happened for Amber — what can I say? It was such an emotional night and I was more focused on being in the moment than getting a 4K video. However, what is captured is high quality, and is of a very memorable show. For transparency, some screenshots include the obstructed/less-than-HQ moments, so people know what they're purchasing/watching.

Hadestown - Broadway
October, 2023 - TheatreCouple14
CAST:
Reeve Carney (Orpheus), Solea Pfeiffer (Eurydice), Phillip Boykin (Hades), Betty Who (Persephone), Max Kumangai (u/s Hermes), Amelia Cormack (Fate), Lindsey Hailes (Fate), Tara Jackson (u/s Fate), Emily Afton (Worker), Malcolm Armwood (Worker), Alex Puette (Worker), Tanner Ray Wilson (s/w Worker), Grace Yoo (Worker)
NOTES:
Excellent wide-shot phone boot from the mid-orchestra. First minute and a half are overexposed, but it's fixed after a slight dropout. Zero obstruction except when a couple people walk out during "Build The Wall". "Doubt Comes In" is mostly dark, that scene is always hard to capture cuz it's so dark. Includes We Raise Our Cups. Absolutely in love with this new cast. Amazing performances from all, but my favorite is definitely Phillip Boykin. He brings complete new life to Hades. Includes video, audio (tracked by Medium Observation and untracked), and cast board photo

Hair - Hollywood Bowl
August 1, 2014 - SJ Bernly
CAST:
Hunter Parrish (Claude), Kristen Bell (Sheila), Benjamin Walker (Berger), Jonah Platt (Woof), Mario (Hud), Jenna Ushkowitz (Jeanie), Amber Riley (Dionne), Sarah Hyland (Crissy)
NOTES:
A fantastic capture of the Hollywood Bowl's annual Broadway show. This production follows the 2009 revival staging fairly closely with some occasional improvised lines and different blocking to accommodate the larger stage. The cast is full of energy; Hunter and Benjamin make a great pair. Kristen's voice isn't as strong as the others, but she's still fun to watch. Amber was the standout for me; she kills all of her solos. Filmed on a tripod, so it's very steady except for the occasional jerkiness when panning. There is a bit of grain in the video due to the distance from the stage, but it's well captured with no blackouts. The only obstruction happens when someone briefly walks across the walkway in front of the camera. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent as usual. Includes curtain call, encore, and playbill scans.

NOTES:
The man, the myth, the legend. This year's most talked about show, fully captured. Enjoy. This is a great capture overall; there some heads at the bottom and sides that can be seen occasionally, especially in wider shots, but they are worked around when necessary and rarely affect the action. There are no major blackouts, just a few quick dropouts, mostly between scenes. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

NOTES:
Beautiful HD video of the new Broadway cast of Hamilton! There are a few drop-outs and obstructions here and there in Act One but overall it's worked around. Act One is mostly close-ups and starts at Laurens' rap. Act Two picks up in the middle of "What Did I Miss?" and features both close-ups and wider shots. I did move during intermission so Act Two has almost no obstructions, but honestly I don't even care. This performance - this cast - deserved to be captured on video. The colors pick up gorgeously, my favorite parts of the staging are captured just right, and I even rested my camera on my backpack to help steady it when I was overcome with emotion and shaking. Just wow.

Harvey - Second Broadway Revival
2012 - Pro-Shot
CAST:

Lofgren), Tracee Chimo (Myrtle Mae Simmons), Holley Fain (Ruth Kelly, R.N.), Angela Paton (Mrs. Ethel Chauvenet), Rich Sommer (Duane Wilson), Morgan Spector (Lyman Sanderson, M.D.)
NOTES:
As its fourth online offering, Roundabout Remote presents a never-before-seen video of our production of Harvey. Jim Parsons stars as one of modern theatre's most lovable characters, Elwood P. Dowd. Charming and kind, Elwood has only one character flaw: an unwavering friendship with a six-foot-tall, invisible rabbit named Harvey. In order to save the family's reputation, Elwood's sister, Veta (Jessica Hecht), takes him to the local sanitarium. But when Dr. William Chumley (Charles Kimbrough) mistakenly commits anxiety-ridden Veta instead of her brother, it sets off a hilarious whirlwind of confusion and chaos as everyone tries to catch a man and his invisible rabbit.

NOTES:
Closing matinee. Full show recorded from the mezzanine with dropouts when the cast was nearby. Also (dancing) heads in the way but I work around them well. Video focuses on Alaska, Tiffany and Shanice but the others all have decent footage. So happy that this production is preserved, it was the best theatre experience I ever had (when I saw the show on the dance floor) and I tried to capture it as best as I could. I apologize for the inconvenience of the dropouts but I was so anxious about getting spotted by the cast. I only dropped out when they were on the catwalk or in the mezzanine facing me and actively interacting with the audience. Full audio of this performance AND the 8pm closing show included.

NOTES:
A near perfect capture and the first known DVD of this show's Off-Broadway run. Barrett is incredibly talented: amazing vocals, acting and comedic timing. Dan and Charissa are both fantastic in their roles as well. The show is absolutely hysterical, much improved from the movie version. The first minute of Act One is blacked out, but the show is otherwise fully intact with no blackouts and only slight washout in a few wide shots. There is no obstruction, the video is steady, the sound is excellent, and it's captured very well with the usual mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. It's filmed in 16:9 and includes curtain call, encore, and playbill scans.

June 30, 2023 - bikinibottomday
CAST:
Arielle Jacobs (Imelda), Jose Llana (Marcos), Conrad Ricamora (Ninoy Aquino), Melody Butiu (Estrella Cumpas), Moses Villarama (DJ), Reanne Acasio (Aurora Aquino), Jasmine Forsberg (Mary Luisa / Imelda’s Inner Voice / Interviewer), Julia Abueva (Dovie Beams), Kristina Doucette (Cory Aquino), Sarah Kay (TV Reporter), Timothy Matthew Flores (Aquino's Son), Jeigh Madjus (Press Attaché), Geena Quintos (Ensemble), Shea Renne (Ensemble), Aaron Alcaraz (Ensemble), Nathan Angelo (Ensemble), Roy Flores (Ensemble)
NOTES:
Okay 4K capture of this part of a show. Due to the unconventional staging in this theatre, it is more or less impossible to not be at least a little obstructed no matter the view. Some of the action at the very front is cut off, and when needed, the screens are occasionally filmed instead of the stage. Increased wandering and unfocusing throughout. Blackouts or complete obstruction during the audience dance sequences (not that anything happens), and the first one runs a little longer into the song. Includes curtain call and encore sequence, audio is fed from external source.

NOTES:
Idina's last performance. An emotional performance by the whole cast, particularly Idina. Her feelings overcome her during Always Starting Over and the Finale, leading to roaring cheers of support from the crowd. There is also a fantastic blooper during What If: Elizabeth's phone rings and the phone is not in her pocket. Chaos ensues. A really fantastic capture with no obstruction, no washout, and just two quick dropouts in act one. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans. A

NOTES:
Closing performance. This is arguably the best of the four. 4K and 1080p, from right mezzanine. Very steady filming. Almost no obstructions - minimal heads in house right side on widest shots. About 1-minute dropout during Finale when house lights come up. Includes curtain call. Funny mishap when Denée's slipper flew into the audience, causing her to break while Sara went to retrieve it. NPH and Gavin Creel were a little extra goofy, too.

NOTES:
Camera is pointed at the live screen during the whole show, except during "Ever After" and the Finale where it points to the stage. Starts in the middle of the Prologue, shortly after the Witch arrives. Exact date is unclear since one act was labelled the 27th and the other 28th. This could simply be a typing mistake by the master since both acts seem to be from one performance.

LOTS of cheers and screaming and laughter from fans excited about this production moving to Broadway. A fair amount of obstruction from heads that is worked around as best as possible - examples of the obstruction can be seen in the screenshots.

CAST:
Matthew Broderick (Peter Austin), Nathan Lane (James Wicker), Megan Mullally (Julia Budder), Stockard Channing (Virginia Noyes), F. Murray Abraham (Ira Drew), Rupert Grint (Frank Finger), Micah Stock (Gus)
NOTES:
A decent capture of the play's original cast. *The play is absolutely hysterical — Nathan, Megan, and Micah being particularly fantastic. This capture has no washout and only minor obstruction, but most of the first 26 minutes of Act One are blacked out. After that, the show is very nicely captured with just one head that can occasionally be seen at the bottom of the screen and does not affect the action. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is very good overall, but there is more shuffling and static than usual; all of the dialogue is listenable.

This dazzling world premiere welcomes you into Jaja’s bustling hair braiding shop in Harlem where every day, a lively and eclectic group of West African immigrant hair braiders are creating masterpieces on the heads of neighborhood women. During one sweltering summer day, love will blossom, dreams will flourish and secrets will be revealed. The uncertainty of their circumstances simmers below the surface of their lives and when it boils over, it forces this tight-knit community to confront what it means to be an outsider on the edge of the place they call home. This extraordinary new play is by the award winning Ghanaian-American playwright Jocelyn Bioh (School Girls; Or, The African Mean Girls Play) and will be directed by Obie winner Whitney White (Our Dear Dead Drug Lord).

NOTES:
In honor of The King and I closing, here is a nice capture of the final cast from the week before it closed. Marin and Daniel are wonderful; Marin’s voice soars, Daniel has great comedic timing, and they have a nice chemistry together. The show is as strong as ever. There is no major obstruction, just a couple heads that can occasionally be seen but don’t block the action. There are a couple quick dropouts, but no major blackouts. There is some slight washout in a few of the wider shots. It’s filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

Barbara Stultz (Mimi), London Riley Keller (Laurel), Júlia Cerqueira (Rosie), Divya Sarma (s/b Beez), Aingea Venuto (Cynthia), Paola Goyco-Velez (Iris), Dot Davis (Clover), Grayson James (Chaz)
NOTES:
By Riley Elton McCarthy, directed by Colleen Morgen. A response play to Mart Crowley’s groundbreaking gay historical play, THE BOYS IN THE BAND, THE LESBIAN PLAY takes us into the lives of the other letters of the queer alphabet on the night of the 2016 election. When Boston University’s Women Loving Women club celebrates the birthday of one of their own, a newfound revelation about the identity of the club secretary descends the club into all-out identity politics warfare, where their friendships, and their sacred safe space's survival, is put to the ultimate test. THE LESBIAN PLAY is a war cry for the "more" that queer people deserve, a demand for action, and a celebration of the lesbian, bisexual, and trans voices that need to be heard.

NOTES:
NFT except from master (in other words -- email me and we can trade for it no problem!) Well, it sure is a thing that exists! (Which is saying a lot as far as bootlegs for this show go) Act I has a lot of framing issues due to the bar, and performers' heads are hard to see in lots of scenes. This is mostly fixed for Act II. There's no washout, however, and the sound is great. My friends and I laugh quite loudly at a lot of our favorite jokes/references, but it doesn't cut off anyone's lines.

NOTES:
A great capture of this fun and energetic show during it's Off-Broadway run. The sets/props are minimal but inventive, and the music is very catchy. The cast is very fun to watch -- they do a great job of switching between characters and supporting each other. A very nice capture overall. There is a railing that can occasionally be seen at the bottom of the screen, but it never blocks more than the actors' feet. The video occasionally wanders just a little, and there are a couple quick dropouts, but no major blackouts. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. The show is 60 minutes with no intermission. Includes playbill scans.

NOTES:
Excellent source for a video of its age… with some qualifications. Definitely suffers from some scratches and a diagonal pulse which resisted being filtered out in the brighter sections of the picture. Sound has been extensively scrubbed and improved. Mostly a wide, fixed shot that occasionally goes into mids.

Good capture focused on the characters and staging of this phenomenal regional production! There is slight obstruction at the bottom of the stage from a head during act one, which is cleared up after a brief blackout at the beginning of act two. Other than that, it is unobstructed and follows the action well.

A Little Night Music - First Broadway Revival
September 4, 2010 - NYCG8R
CAST:

NOTES:
Due to disruptions in the audience, "Now, Later, Soon" and a scene in Act II are replaced with those from the recording made on April 4, 2010, and the beginning of "Liaisons" is taken instead from a recording from a few days earlier, as is the last minute of Act I. The edits are well made, and make the best recording possible with no cast changes.

NOTES:
Very good phone boot of this incredible show. All action captured, although some of the darker scenes are a little hard to make out, but that's less than 8% of the show, I'd say. Honestly, you would not know anyone here was an understudy. They were all exceptional. The most reactive audience I've ever seen in NYC. I swear at least half of the audience was in a production of the show at some point in their lives with how much they were dancing and lip-syncing along. So much applause and laughter. Bonus that it's Skylar Astin, cuz C'mon, he's adorable in everything.

NOTES:
Great 4K capture of Joy's phenomenal performance as Audrey! A lot of Act Two is wide blindshot due to ushers, from the beginning of the act to the middle of "Suppertime" and most of Audrey's final scene. Most action is still captured. Audio fed from external source.

NOTES:
Includes the full show and the curtain call. There is some drifting in Act One, but it isn't as prevalent in Act Two. There are a lot of obstructions, but I was (mostly) able to film around them. The only part that was really blocked was Somewhere That's Green. Somewhere That's Green (Reprise) is the only majorly whitewashed part, but other than that it's not too much of an issue. Overall, it's a pretty decent capture of the show, considering it's my first video master.

NOTES:
Final performance: a good mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups shots but a little more obstruction here, but it mostly just blocks the actors' feet/legs sometimes; some washout in the wides, and the dialogue is pretty quiet sometimes, but it's all still understandable. Many changes had been made since the previous video, most notably in The Girl Who Drove Away, Drive, and Sam's monologue after I Wouldn't Change Anything. A

NOTES:
The annual Hollywood Bowl production never disappoints. Jennifer absolutely kills it, and there are some brilliant comedic moments from the whole cast. This capture is nearly perfect with just a couple quick dropouts and some brief moments where the video wanders or goes out of focus, but never for more than a few seconds. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call, encores, and playbill scans.

NOTES:
Multi-camera proshot filmed for CDT. The orchestrations are soundboard, though the dialogue is not. (some traders list this in their notes: "Voulez Vous lighting is out-of-sync, though the dance moves are still in-time—unfortunately, the last 20 minutes of the show are out-of-sync completely" however, that's not true for all copies, so ask before you trade.)

NOTES:
Closing night on Broadway! The final Broadway show performance! Lots of energy from the cast and audience! Denise Wood gave a nice speech after the curtain call. A good capture overall, there are a few heads that can be seen at the bottom of the screen throughout the show, but it is worked around and doesn't block more than the actors feet. There are about 3 minutes of blackouts during miracle, and a few other quick dropouts throughout the show. Telly is partially captured. Its filmed in 16:9 with a mix of wides, mediums and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call, speech and playbill scans

NOTES:
Shot in 4K with a lot of close-ups. Camera occasionally wanders during dialogue, but it's generally good during the songs. There was some obstruction on the right side that I couldn't work around, but altogether most of the action is captured as the staging of the show puts everything major in the center. I am obviously not practiced yet in taking videos, but if you want to see facial expressions you haven't caught before it's a good boot. The cast is honestly on the top of their game.

Erika Henningsen (Cady Heron), Reneé Rapp (Regina George), Cailen Fu (s/b Gretchen Wieners), Kate Rockwell (Karen Smith), Barrett Wilbert Weed (Janis Sarkisian), Grey Henson (Damian Hubbard), Cameron Dallas (t/r Aaron Samuels), Cheech Manohar (Kevin Gnapoor), Catherine Brunell (Mrs. Heron/Ms. Norbury/Mrs. George), Rick Younger (Principal Duvall), Drew Redington (Mr. Heron), Teddy Toye (Coach Carr/Glen Coco/Math Moderator), Stephanie Lynn Bissonnette (Dawn Schweitzer), Collins Conley (Lizzie Therman/Caroline Krafft), Jake Swain (Tyler Kimble), Darius Barnes (Christian Wiggins), Pascal Pastrana (Shane Oman), Riza Takahashi (Sophie Kawachi), Devon Hadsell (Caitlyn Caussin), Curtis Holland (Jason Weems), Daryl Tofa (Marwan Jitla), Susie Carroll (s/w Taylor Wedell), Sasha Hollinger (Rachel Hamilton), Maria Briggs (s/w Grace Akinola), Gianna Yanelli (Sonja Acquino)
NOTES:
Stunning HD capture of Cailen as Gretchen and newcomers Catherine Brunell and social media entrepreneur Cameron Dallas. Filmed in 16:9 from the left orchestra with a mix of wides, mediums, and closeups. Missing the first few seconds of each act but the action is followed perfectly and there are almost no instances of washout or major dropouts.

NOTES:
Some shakiness in the beginning, obstructions on the right from a head that was difficult to shoot around, the last eight minutes of video is blurry, mix of wides and lots of really great zooms that capture all of Olivia's amazing facial expressions—she is a brilliant Regina—so terrifying she gives chills!!

NOTES:
A great capture of Dallas Theater Center's inventively staged production of Les Miserables. The much-talked about production did not disappoint; the modernized visuals create many new layers to the show, and make you think about events and characters in a whole new way. Nehal, Allison, Justin, and Christia were probably my favorites, but the entire cast is so talented, it's difficult to choose any as standouts. A very nice capture overall. There are a couple quick dropouts in act one, but no major blackouts. There is one head that can be seen occasionally, but it only blocks a small portion of the stage and only affects the action for about 20-30 seconds of the entire show. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent as usual. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

NOTES:
Filmed in widescreen (though encoded in 4:3, so there are bars at the top and bottom of the screen), this is a nice capture of some of the new cast members. Drew and Ann give great performances in their roles. The second disc also includes the first 15 minutes of the February 24, 2007 Evening show, filmed from the rear right orchestra.

NOTES:
The trap door, usually used by the Thenardiers in "One Day More" and Valjean in the aftermath of the Final Battle, seems to be stuck shut during this performance. Therefore, the Thenardiers spend "One Day More" kneeling on the ground, and Valjean awkwardly tries and fails to open the door during the aftermath scene.

NOTES:
Decent wide-shot phone boot from mid-orchestra. A few of the scenes are washed out (This show has some BRIGHT lights), and some of the action on the extreme left side is missed (Corrected for act 2). I think this might be my favorite Christian/Satine combo though. Powerhouse performances from John and Yvette. Apologies for some silly questions from my older neighbor that can be heard in the audio. Includes video, audio (tracked by ThroughTheNight and untracked), and digital program

NOTES:
A disaster of a phone boot taken from the back of the circle. It's bad. It's so bad. It's barely a video. But it exists! Act 1 is extremely washed out, act 2 is too dark, both are out of focus and move around a lot as I was in standing room

NOTES:
Master wrote down that Jefferson Mays was on as the mayor in this performance, but it's not him judging by the video. Given the actor playing the mayor is white and Branch was the only white u/s for the mayor, it's probably him.

NOTES:
Phone boot filmed in horizontal 4K & scaled down to 1080p. One minor dropout (~2 mins) in Act2, otherwise all the action is captured. Taking photos was allowed (and encouraged) at this production, but not video – therefore, framing is better when I was "taking a photo" vs when I was "just holding my phone", but I didn't have to explicitly hide it, so I could earily get around obstructions.

NOTES:
Excellent 4K capture of the penultimate performance of this world premiere musical. There’s some washout on the wider shots. The action on the far right is sometimes obstructed, as well as one small head obstruction at the bottom. There are occasional moments of wandering and unfocusing. Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source. If you listen carefully at the end, you can hear the master, alongside the entire audience, sobbing.

CAST:
Adam Bashian (Ed), Kim Blanck (Karly), Alex Gibson (Henry), Justin Gregory Lopez (Toby), Isabel Santiago (Paula), Margo Seibert (Jessica), Kuhoo Verma (Velma), J.D. Mollison (Marvin)
NOTES:
Semi-blind-shot filmed over & between heads. Significant drifting and ceiling views during times when I wasn't checking my screen, and lots of movement from holding the camera too close to my body when I felt too exposed. (It's a small space in the round.) There's also a ~3 minute dropout starting around 01:17:30 when the camera battery died – secondary audio from the same show is inserted in the gap. Having said all that, you can follow everything that happens in this weird/wonderful show, and certain scenes came out pretty nice in the footage. I included an auto-stabilized version in the folder, which might help a little bit with dizziness if you're sensitive to that, but I don't claim that to be a real fix.

NOTES:
Okay 4K capture of this stunning play. There is a major head obstruction that sometimes blocks off action on the left side, but due to nearly the entire play being a monologue, it is worked around well. Increased wandering due to working around the head. The folder also contains a copy of the interview with Adrienne Kennedy that served as the preshow audio. Includes curtain call, audio fed from external source.

NOTES:
Blind lapshot with no zooms, and there are frequently two heads in the way, and the angle is occasionally lopsided slightly. Other issues: Curly being out of the shot for most of The Surrey With The Fringe On Top; shakiness and my hands/playbill being visible during applause breaks because I had to clap; head obstruction during I Cain't Say No; some floorshots during Dream Ballet; mic feedback during louder parts; and random bits where I was focusing on the wrong thing/person due to shooting blind. There's also some parts where the audio cuts off for a second, doesn't perfectly align with the frames, or the video freezes or goes dark while the audio keeps playing. Neither of these glitches last for more than a second, but still must be noted.

NOTES:
Video picks up part way through the opening number but there's a lot of wandering for the first five or so minutes. Second act starts at the beginning of the dream ballet and ends at curtain call. The lighting in this show is kinda weird and my camera had some trouble focusing, especially in the super dark/light scenes. There's one usher dropout during Kansas City that lasts for about a minute. There's also about 10 minutes split between 2 scenes where the entire stage is completely dark (don't worry you aren't missing anything).

Great wide-show phone boot of the incredible closing of such a fun show. A bit of washout in the brightest scenes. A few brief obstructions when latecomers or seated or ushers running through the aisle to stop people from filming (seriously, it feels like these were olympic trained runners). A few tiny dropouts to stand for applause. Lots of extra applause from a fully fan audience. Quite a few times you can hear me and my husband screaming for the actors, sorry, not sorry.

NOTES:
Good wide-shot 16x9 video of this bound-for-Broadway show that tells the stories of fairytale princesses through the music of Britney Spears. Video is a little dark in some scenes. Head covers the bottom left of the screen and a railing on the bottom right, but neither hides more than 5% of the action of the show. Never to be sold. Gifting Encouraged. Includes Video, Audio (tracked and untracked), and digital program.

NOTES:
A few blackouts here and there, mostly during applause. One major cover-up that goes from the end of "Gotta Get Out" through all of "Favorite Places" and the very beginning of "Rooftop Duet". One head in the way, but was shot around as much as possible.

Eiland, Joey Ginza, Richard Magpiong, Tony Marinyo, Kevin Maung
NOTES:
Pro-shot. Two performances were filmed — the matinee and evening performances on June 9, 1976 — and were edited together for the version that was broadcast. Originally shown in Japan in a version edited to 120 minutes. For unknown reasons, at this performance, Mako performed the slightly abridged version of the opening speech (prior to "The Advantages of Floating in the Middle of the Sea") that is heard on the original cast recording. In the production, he usually did the longer version of the speech (as it appears in the published script).

NOTES:
A fantastic capture of this one-night-only concert at Avery Fisher Hall. Jeremy and Laura give incredible performances, as does Joshua Henry and too many others to name. Jason Robert Brown gives a speech after the curtain call. Truly an epic night of theatre. This is a very near perfect video with no obstruction and only slight washout in wide shots. There are two quick dropouts in the first few minutes, but the concert is otherwise fully captured. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call, Jason's speech, and playbill scans.

Beautiful, clear picture with great detail and quality, and the entire cast was on fire. The original video should not have black bars on the top and bottom.

NOTES:
Filmed during previews. This would be perfect, however, it’s not as steady as I’d like it to be, the first act is a little overexposed, and the third act is slightly underexposed. I’d still say it’s a great capture even though it has flaws. Recording includes the curtain call and marquee.

NOTES:
Excellent capture of this year's Hollywood Bowl production. Action is followed well with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The first minute of the show is missing, and the next few minutes are a bit shaky with scattered blackouts, but after "The King of Broadway" it settles and the majority of the show is captured nicely. SPOILER: Before "Keep It Gay" started, when Roger says "What's the word?" someone from the audience shouted out "Gay" which sent the cast into a laughing fit.

NOTES:
Gift upon request. Unobstructed closing performance with the full cast! Starts in the beginning of "Changing Lives" and is a little washed out. For whatever reason my camera was mad at me and didn't want to focus in the beginning of Act One. It warmed up and got better, and to be honest I opted for wider shots because everyone was doing crazy things and I didn't want to miss anything. I stood up for all but one of the standing ovations and when I did so I have no idea what my camera did or what it was looking at. I would say sorry but it wouldn't be true. I'm just so damn proud of all of these people. Please do not post this bootleg publicly!

NOTES:
Pretty good wide-shot phone boot from the far left front orchestra. Recorded from the 2nd row, there is a bit of obstruction from a head on the bottom left 20% of the screen, but barely covers any actual action. Because of the extreme angle, sometimes when the queens are far upstage (On the throne, etc), they're not in the shot, and sometimes a queen in front will cover the highlighted queen. Great audio, and a very enthusiastic audience. TheatreCouple14's master. Never to be sold. Gifting Encouraged

Ed Asner (Milton Saltzman), Tovah Feldshuh (Esther Feinman / Brenda Goodsen), Ned Eisenberg (Comic / Daniel Silver / Smirnov / Mazur / Neely), Liba Vaynberg (Annie Blumberg)
NOTES:
PBS pro-shot of the Concert reading. Set more than fifty years after WWII, a young Jewish reporter grapples with different versions of the same story – did the Nazis make soap from the corpses of murdered Jews? The Soap Myth dramatizes the painful confrontation between survivors, scholars, and Holocaust deniers, and questions who has the right to write history.

NOTES:
A nice capture overall; the biggest flaw here is the obstruction. There are a lot of heads that were very difficult to work around, but the show is still captured well and the actors are only occasionally blocked for a few seconds at a time. There are some very quick dropouts, but no major blackouts. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes playbill scans.

A Strange Loop - Broadway
May, 2022 - The Musical Speakeasy

Jaquel Spivey (Usher), L Morgan Lee (Thought 1), James Jackson Jr. (Thought 2), John-Michael Lyles (Thought 3), John Andrew Morrison (Thought 4), Jason Veasey (Thought 5), Antwayn Hopper (Thought 6)
NOTES:
Technical Notes: Camcorder video captured in 4K. Recorded from the front row of the balcony, which has a notoriously obstructive bar, and the bottom of the stage is blocked by it and a light hung right in front of it. It's navigated around alright, and doesn't ever block out much of the action. No washout. The camera picks up two minutes in and gets settled halfway through the second number. There are a couple brief blackouts throughout, but never more than a couple seconds. Very clear audio. [B+/A-] Performance Notes: What can be said about this musical that hasn't been said already? The endless awards for its writing speaks for itself. A Strange Loop is one of the most refreshing and exciting new musicals to have hit Broadway in ages, and for it to be given such an elaborate and tight presentation in this slick production is a delight. This was the first full performance back in a while for Jaquel after a short absence, and his return was a delight (both to the audience and to the rest of his company, as indicated in the curtain call.)

NOTES:
Decent wide-shot phone boot from the back of the orchestra. As usual, dark scenes are pretty hard to make out, and there is obstruction by a head for about the left 20% of the stage. But, first known video of Kyle as Usher and he's absolutely incredible. Includes video, audio (tracked and untracked), and understudy slip.

Roberts,
NOTES:
For some reason (covid?) the tour company manager was on in the pastor/doctor track so that's fun. My camera did not like the lighting/large bright rectangle set pieces and at times has a lot of trouble focusing/light correcting. There are two heads on either side of the frame and I worked around them the best I could but some action is lost, especially when the owners of the heads leaned in. The show was really loud so during some of the bigger numbers the mic fuzzes out, it's mostly not too noticeable except for Hot Stuff where its the entire song. Video ends part way through curtain call.

NOTES:
The full show is captured with a brief blackout during No Life and a minute afterward, up until the end of Putting It Together in which the video becomes just audio. This production is one of the most unique experiences I've had in a while, and I'm very lucky to have been able to capture such an anomaly of a production in such a unique space. It's fantastically intimate which often leads to the actors being a couple feet away from the master, getting some impressive shots. The production was mounted by Chillina Kennedy's theatre company with ten days of rehearsal time and features some remarkable performances, very creative staging in a non-theatrical space and some great orchestrations.

NOTES:
Highlights: Johanna, Kiss Me, and Act 2 until part of Johanna (Reprise). A bunch of clips from the opening night of Sweeney Todd in Manila! Shot 3rd row at the balcony. I shot more but they were too zoomed in that they're more likely to be considered audio so I decided not to include them. I was very near the usher and they were really strict. The phone was in my jacket pocket so I couldn't see anything and I was scared of getting caught, so a lot is very zoomed and I'm really sorry about that. I absolutely loved the set, it was reimagined into a more modern almost gangster like setting. Shot in 4k on my phone. Please gift out to anyone who asks.

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street - Third Broadway Revival

CAST:
Josh Groban (Sweeney Todd), Annaleigh Ashford (Mrs. Lovett), Jordan Fisher (Anthony Hope), Maria Bilbao (Johanna), Jamie Jackson (Judge Turpin), Gaten Matarazzo (Tobias Ragg), John Rapson (Beadle Bamford), Jeanna de Waal (s/b Beggar Woman), Nicholas Christopher (Adolfo Pirelli), Danny Rothman (t/r Jonas Fogg), Jonathan Christopher (Bird Seller), Patricia Phillips (Passerby), Galyana Castillo (Ensemble), Taeler Cyrus (Ensemble), Timothy Hughes (Ensemble), Paul-Jordan Jansen (Ensemble), Alicia Kaori (Ensemble), Raymond J.

NOTES:
Excellent 4K capture of this revival! Increased wandering / readjustment and unfocusing throughout. Some minor head obstruction in the second act that is worked around very well. Other obstruction throughout only lasts for a second or two each time. Due to the angle, some of Johanna's moments are blocked off by the archway. Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source.

CAST:

NOTES:
A good HD capture with all things considered. This was a very small Theater and almost staged Theatre-in-the-round. Part of the railing lines the bottom of the screen for most scenes, which also can block actors far downstage left. All that considered, still a very enjoyable rare capture and performances. B+

Head on the right side, but doesn't cover anything at all except bottom of legs in 2 scenes. Really cool to see the little boat close-up.

Larissa FastHorse's wickedly funny comedy finds a troupe of terminally “woke” teaching artists scrambling to create a pageant that manages to celebrate both Turkey Day and Native American Heritage Month. “A delicious roasting” (NY Times) of the politics of entertainment and political correctness, The Thanksgiving Play puts the American origin story in the comedy-crosshairs.

Halfway decent wide-shot phone video from the mid orchestra. Not a lot of clarity on faces, but the projections and set can be seen pretty well. Slightly underexposed, some of the dark scenes are pretty dark, but 97% of the action is captured. Some obstruction when the woman in front of me wanted to interpretive dance throughout the show. Someone's phone beeped like 12x in the audio. Large staging of this normally intimate musical. The A-List cast did a great job. Includes video, audio (Tracked and untracked), & digital program

NOTES:
Mostly the performers' heads from the first 20 minutes of the show – the phone camera was pointed at a bad angle, and after that point this became pure ceiling footage. Not really what I intended, but it does help me relive my memories of Marla Mindelle and John Riddle looking at me, and it may give you the basic vibe of the show.

NOTES:
Front row phone boot filmed in horizontal 4K & scaled down to 1080p. The extreme angle means parts of the action is missed, but, you do get some butt-closeups! You win some, you lose some. Frankie Grande references the Six shirt I'm wearing and says Céline "is, like, the seventh wife".

NOTES:
Decent wide-shot phone boot of this spectacularly hilarious show. Unfortunately, this theatre is extremely hard to film in. Shot between heads and over audience seats. Some action on the far right of the stage is missed, but overall watchable. This was the most fun night of theater I've had in ages. Such smart and silly humor. Quite a few understudies on, but you'd have no idea. Every single vocal performance was flawless. Some of the best sound mixing I've heard in NYC. Can't recommend this show enough. TheatreCouple14's master. Never to be sold. Gifting Encouraged

NOTES:
Exceptional close-up video from the first few rows of the Daryl Roth. Filmed in 4k vertical and edited in 3:2 1080p. A few moments are missed when actors are on either far sides of the stage or behind the filmer. This was the "Tistanique" fan night performance, so the crowd is rabid, and the cast members are completely unhinged. So many amazing new adlibs (especially from Drew, who made almost ever person on stage break at one point). The improv section is all about Constantine and Marla (writers of the show)'s journey to get it to stage, and a lot of other jokes at their expense (to their immense delight). Lots of laughter and ruckus applause from the audience. Includes all the after-show shenanigans including trivia, a drawing contest, and a lip-sync turned strip show. A wild night was had by all. Definitely can't recommend this show enough. It's shiploads of fun.

NOTES:
Jackie Burns' last show. Very good wide-shot phone boot from smack dab center orchestra. All action captured greatly. This was Jackie Burns' last show, and everyone was on FIRE. Jackie gets a standing ovation when she first gets on stage and takes a long time to recover. Absolutely hilarious improv where she talked about Jackie's career and leaving the job. Brandon called back to it later on with a "Justice for Jackie Burns" line and all the cast of Color raised the solidarity fist. Filmer got the eggplant, so that scene is a bit cut off. Includes speech at the end to mark her last show. TheatreCouple14's master. Never to be sold. Gifting Encouraged. Includes video, audio (tracked and untracked), and cast board photo

Welch (Tom Robinson), Luke Smith (Horace Gilmer), David Christopher Wells (Sheriff Heck Tate), Joey Collins (Bob Ewell), Arianna Gayle Stucki (Mayella Ewell), Jaqueline Williams (Calpurnia), Richard Thomas (Atticus Finch), Richard Poe (Judge Taylor), Greg Wood (Mr. Roscoe/Dr. Reynolds), Travis Johns (Mr. Cunningham/Boo Radley), Liv Rooth (Miss Stephanie/Dill's Mother), Mary Badham (Mrs. Henry Dubose), Anthony Natale (Link Deas), Morgan Bernhard, Denise Cormier, Glenn Fleary, Maeve Moynihan, Daniel Neale, Dorcas Sowunmi (Ensemble)
NOTES:
Good wide-shot phone boot of the National Tour. Some of the less-lit scenes can be pretty dark. Heads cover the left and right of the stage, but most of the action is captured, as it's in the center. This cast is phenomenal and really took the audience through a range of emotions. Includes audio. TheatreCouple14's master. Never to be sold. Gifting Encouraged.

April, 2019 - StarCuffedJeans

Betts (Nurse Norma), Tess Murphy (Lulu), Stephanie Torns (Francine Pomatter), Molly Hager (Mother), Dan Tracy (Father)
NOTES:
A nearly perfect video and ABSOLUTELY PERFECT performance. Small obstructions occur at Joe's table (but who cares) and during Negative. The rest of show, however, is captured gorgeously (and this time not diagonally). The video is very Shoshana focused, but I try to give everyone (yes, Jeremy too) their moments. The colors are absolutely vivid and I was trying new stabilization settings on my camera and god I'm gonna keep it this way. Do not list this video with an exact date.

CAST:

NOTES:
Good HD capture of Jordin's brilliant take on the main role. Act One starts right when “The Negative” begins. Act Two begins just a few lines into the Act. There are a couple of dropouts throughout the show but none lasting more than 10 seconds, with most being significantly shorter than that. Some very slight wandering as the master changed camera angles or focused on someone taking photos of the show with an iPhone. Please do not post screenshots of this video on Twitter ever. Gifs on Tumblr are okay after the NFT date, but don't go linking things to actors and shows.

NOTES:
Housecam footage of a dress rehearsal, filmed with one stationary camera that zooms in and out on the actors. Sound patched in from soundboard (dialogue is taken from the housecam and sometimes the soundboard and songs are almost always soundboarded). At this point the cast hadn't played in front of a paying audience ever and were still rehearsing lines so keep that in mind. Also Lulu is not in this rehearsal, so the cast imagine interacting with her (for those who haven't seen the show, she's a character who comes out in the last 5 minutes so you won't miss much).

NOTES:
Starts at the beginning of "I Just Wanna" and missing part of "Mattie's Lament." The theater was really full tonight so there are a good number of heads in this video, but they are worked around to the best of my ability. This is a super small theater (less than 160 seats) and at times the cast members were definitely singing to the camera and honestly giving their best performances because of it. All of the things on the upper level (the bathroom, the pathway, and the kitchen) are captured perfectly, and the zooms on the lower level (the living room and bench) look good as well. Obviously because this is a murder mystery kind of show the lighting can get a little bit dark, but my camera handles low lighting incredibly well. This is honestly the best video you could expect from this venue

NOTES:
This concert version of the show is abridged with shortened scenes, simple costumes, and no sets or choreography, but Jeremy, Solea, and Karen are absolutely phenomenal with soaring vocals and emotional performances. Very well captured with no dropouts, no obstruction, and no washout. The stage is filmed directly most of the time; the screens are occasionally filmed, usually when the actors are not onstage. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

NOTES:
Shoshana's, David's, Rue's and Michelle's last performance. The whole cast was really having fun, very high audience energy throughout. Megan and Shoshana have a really funny bit during Popular, and the crowd went wild. Camera wanders quite a bit and is shaky at points due to the master's blind filming, plus some spotlight washout. Still, this recording is an absolute gem. Includes playbill scans and Megan's speech in the end.

NOTES:
Final Performance of Stephanie J. Block. Great capture of possibly the best performance ever given by an Elphaba. SJB lit the stage on fire, honestly this is one of the best individual performances I have ever attended. With such power and control, this is one Wicked NOT to be missed, you will be amazed! A

NOTES:
Beautiful video, the first starring Nicole Parker, the first Broadway Elphaba to never have played the role before. Throughout the show she looks at the camera and basically performs for it. Examples are "I'm not that girl" and "Defying Gravity." She notices it pretty much straight away at the beginning of "Wizard and I"

NOTES:
This is a vivid 4K video with almost no obstructions. Pretty much everything is centered, with beautiful zooms but also wider shots that showcase the dancing and set design. At times the video appears on an angle because my wrists are weak, but you don't miss anything because of it. There is also washout at times, but I do believe my camera handles the spotlights better than a lot of Wicked videos. Act 2 starts a minute into the performance. All in all this is a gorgeous capture of old and new cast members... I'm not finished yet in this bootleg business but if I was this could be my magnum opus.

NOTES:
A nice capture of Laurel taking over as Elphaba and Katie's return to Broadway. There's a blackout until midway through No One Mourns the Wicked, and the show is full from there, although a head obstructs the far righthand side of the stage. There's a couple dropouts every once in a while but the zooms make up for that. Filmed in 16:9, and includes the curtain call.

NOTES:
4K vertical phone footage cropped to horizontal 1080p. A bit over 50 mins of footage – Act 2 (ending just before For Good), with No One Mourns The Wicked and Defying Gravity (AKA the aerial scenes from Act 1 that were not 100% obsturcted) included in the beginning. Pretty washed out and often obsctructed, but what's included is watchable – wanted to put this out there as this ended up being Ginna Claire's (unplanned) last show.

NOTES:
Nice, somewhat shaky capture with some obstruction on the left side; this causes some minor blackouts but it still follows the action well and has plenty of great moments. Alyssa and Brittney make the first pairing where both witches are played by women of color! They have great chemistry and Brittney has grown immensely in the role.

NOTES:
Full show of all of the San Francisco leads, and as far as the master knows, this is the first DVD of Teal and Kendra together. They have great chemistry, and Teal sounds fantastic. The Wizard head malfunctions in the Act II; its turned the wrong way during "Wonderful" and Lee has to improvise a bit. There are a couple of short blackouts during WITF and the classroom scene, and one during the "House in the sky" scene. A bit of wash out here and there, but nothing major. Sound is excellent.
